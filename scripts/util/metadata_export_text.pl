=head1 NAME

metadata_export_text.pl - extract metadata from Tesserae texts

=head1 SYNOPSIS

metadata_export_text.pl [options]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the script I used to get the most recent metadata for our corpus.
It's meant to be used with the "metadata_db" branch of my Tesserae GitHub
repo, which has switched from storing metadata centrally to including it
in the headers of the individual texts (now in XML format).

I've already run this, and the results are bundled with the present code
under "metadata/authors.xml" and "metadata/texts.xml".  This set of 
experiments is designed to use the master branch of the Tesserae repo,
anyway, and so this script won't work here. I'm only bundling it with this 
project rather than with "metadata_db" because for the moment this is all 
I'm using it for.

If you really want to use this, get the "metadata_db" branch working 
somewhere else, then copy this file to Tesserae's scripts/ directory and
run it there, after having installed the corpus.
